# WhatsApp Message Splitting Feature

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: WhatsApp Business API has a hard limit of **4096 characters** per message. When agents generate long responses (e.g., detailed code explanations, deployment instructions), messages would fail with:

```
❌ Error: Message text too long (4749 chars). Maximum is 4096 characters
```

**Solution**: Automatic message splitting that intelligently breaks long messages into multiple parts.

---

## ✨ Features

### 1. **Automatic Message Splitting** (Default Behavior)
- Messages > 4096 chars are automatically split
- No configuration needed - works out of the box
- Preserves all content across multiple messages

### 2. **Intelligent Split Points**
The system tries to split at natural boundaries (in priority order):

1. **Paragraph breaks** (`\n\n`) - Keeps paragraphs together
2. **Line breaks** (`\n`) - Splits at natural line boundaries
3. **Sentence endings** (`. `, `! `, `? `) - Keeps sentences together
4. **Word boundaries** (spaces) - Avoids breaking words
5. **Hard limit** - Falls back to 4096 char splits if necessary

### 3. **Rate Limiting Protection**
- 0.5 second delay between message parts
- Prevents WhatsApp rate limiting when sending multiple chunks

---

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage (Automatic)

```python
from whatsapp_mcp.client import WhatsAppClient

client = WhatsAppClient()

# Long message (5000 chars) - automatically split into 2 messages
long_message = "Your detailed response here..." * 200
client.send_message(to="1234567890", text=long_message)

# Output:
# ⚠️  Message too long (5000 chars). Splitting into multiple messages...
# 📨 Sending 2 messages...
# 📤 Sending part 1/2 (4074 chars)
# ✅ Message sent successfully to 1234567890
# 📤 Sending part 2/2 (926 chars)
# ✅ Message sent successfully to 1234567890
# ✅ All 2 messages sent successfully
```

### Disable Auto-Split (Optional)

```python
# If you want the old behavior (raises error for long messages)
client.send_message(
    to="1234567890",
    text=long_message,
    auto_split=False  # Disable automatic splitting
)
# Raises: ValueError: Message text too long (5000 chars). Maximum is 4096 characters
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### File Modified
**File**: `src/python/whatsapp_mcp/client.py`

### Key Methods

#### `_split_message(text, max_length=4096)`
Splits text into chunks at natural boundaries.

**Algorithm**:
1. If text ≤ 4096 chars → return as single message
2. For each 4096 char chunk:
   - Try paragraph break (if > 50% through chunk)
   - Try line break (if > 50% through chunk)
   - Try sentence end (if > 50% through chunk)
   - Try word boundary (if > 50% through chunk)
   - Fallback: hard split at 4096
3. Return list of chunks

#### `send_message(to, text, auto_split=True)`
Enhanced to handle long messages.

**Parameters**:
- `to`: Phone number (international format)
- `text`: Message content (any length)
- `auto_split`: Enable automatic splitting (default: True)

**Returns**: API response from last message sent

#### `_send_single_message(to, text)`
Internal method for sending individual message chunks.

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
python tests/test_whatsapp_message_splitting.py
```

### Test Coverage

✅ Short messages (< 4096 chars) - Not split
✅ Long messages (> 4096 chars) - Split correctly
✅ Paragraph boundary splitting - Preserves paragraphs
✅ Sentence boundary splitting - Keeps sentences intact
✅ Exact 4096 chars - Single message
✅ 4097 chars - Split into 2 messages

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (No changes needed)

The feature uses existing WhatsApp credentials:
```bash
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_id
```

### Default Settings

```python
MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 4096  # WhatsApp API hard limit
SPLIT_THRESHOLD = 0.5      # Only split at boundary if > 50% through chunk
DELAY_BETWEEN_CHUNKS = 0.5  # Seconds between message parts
```

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Before (Failed)

```
User sends: "Explain this 10-page codebase"
Agent generates: 5000 char response

Result:
❌ Error processing message: Message text too long (5000 chars)
User receives: "Sorry, I encountered an error..."
```

### After (Success)

```
User sends: "Explain this 10-page codebase"
Agent generates: 5000 char response

Result:
⚠️  Message too long (5000 chars). Splitting into multiple messages...
✅ Sent part 1/2
✅ Sent part 2/2
User receives: Complete explanation across 2 messages
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

Messages split events are logged:

```
⚠️  Message too long (4749 chars). Splitting into multiple messages...
📨 Sending 2 messages...
📤 Sending part 1/2 (4074 chars)
✅ Message sent successfully to 16196366280
📤 Sending part 2/2 (675 chars)
✅ Message sent successfully to 16196366280
✅ All 2 messages sent successfully
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Metrics

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Short message (< 4096 chars) | 1 API call | 1 API call (no change) |
| Long message (5000 chars) | ❌ Failed | 2 API calls + 0.5s delay |
| Very long message (10000 chars) | ❌ Failed | 3 API calls + 1s delay |

### Rate Limiting

WhatsApp allows:
- 60 messages/minute per phone number (default)
- With 0.5s delay between chunks → Max 2 messages/sec
- Safe for typical usage patterns

## ✅ Benefits

1. **No More Failed Messages**: Long responses always delivered
2. **Better User Experience**: Complete information received
3. **Intelligent Splitting**: Preserves formatting and readability
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code works without changes
5. **Transparent**: Logging shows when/how messages are split
6. **Tested**: Comprehensive test suite validates behavior

---

## 🎉 Summary

The WhatsApp message splitting feature ensures that **no agent response is too long** for WhatsApp. Messages are automatically split at natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences, words) and delivered as multiple parts, providing a seamless experience for users receiving detailed responses from AI agents.

**Status**: ✅ **Deployed and Tested**
